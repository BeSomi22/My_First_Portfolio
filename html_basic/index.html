    <h1>Welcome to My Simple Web Page</h1>

    <p>
      This page demonstrates basic HTML structure, including multiple paragraph
      elements, headings of various levels, and a clickable image. HTML is the
      foundation of every webpage and learning it is the first step to becoming
      a web developer.
    </p>

    <h2>About HTML Headings</h2>

    <p>
      Headings in HTML range from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to
      <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> being the most
      important. They help organize content and improve accessibility and SEO by
      structuring the document's hierarchy.
    </p>
    <h3>Using Paragraphs for Content</h3>
    <p>
      Paragraphs are created using the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag and are used
      to break text into readable sections. Proper paragraph structure improves
      readability and ensures a smooth flow of information for users.

      Images can be made interactive by wrapping them in anchor tags. This is a
      simple way to create buttons, links, or navigational elements with a
      visual component.
